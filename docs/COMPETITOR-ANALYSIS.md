# Competitor Analysis: turismemaresme.cat

## Overview
Official tourism website backed by Costa Barcelona (Diputació de Barcelona). Professionally designed, comprehensive, but targets a different audience.

## What They Do Well
- Professional presentation
- Multi-language support (CA, ES, EN, FR)
- Comprehensive activity coverage
- Good SEO and official backing
- Downloadable maps and guides
- Accessibility information

## What They Miss (Your Opportunity)

### 1. Nightlife & Party Scene
- Almost no coverage of bars, clubs, parties
- No event calendar for nightlife
- Your audience wants this!

### 2. Practical Tourist Pain Points
- Airport bus info buried/unclear
- No step-by-step "how to get home" guides
- Your tourists ASK you this - solve it!

### 3. Xiringuitos (Beach Bars)
- Not prominently featured
- No events, no party info
- These are social hubs for your audience

### 4. Budget-Focused Content
- Their site is "aspirational" tourism
- Wellness, cycling, wine tours
- Your audience wants: cheap eats, drink deals, beach parties

### 5. Real-Time Events
- Static content
- No "what's happening tonight"
- Events are a major draw

## Their Structure (For Reference)

### Main Sections
1. Discover: Towns, Beaches, Natural parks
2. What to do: Nature, Culture, Adventure, Family, Gastronomy, Wellness, Sports, Shopping, Business, Pet-friendly
3. Blog: Articles and guides

## Your Differentiation Strategy

| They Offer | You Offer |
|------------|-----------|

| Wellness retreats | Xiringuito events |
| Cycling routes | Airport bus directions |
| Wine tourism | Bar deals & happy hours |
| Business events | Weekend party calendar |
| Aspirational content | Practical, real content |

## Co-existence Strategy
- Don't compete on their strengths
- Link to them for "serious" tourism content
- Own the nightlife/party/practical niche
- You solve problems they don't address
