# In-Depth Analysis: MaresmeEvents.cat

## What Is This Website?

- Corporate event planners
- Meeting organizers
- Incentive travel coordinators
- Wedding planners
- Team building organizers
- Conference/congress organizers

**Key Insight:** Both sites appear to be run by or affiliated with the same regional tourism board (Turisme Costa del Maresme), but serve completely different audiences.

## What You Can Learn From This

### 1. Business Model Insight

MaresmeEvents operates as a **directory/referral platform** - they don't provide services themselves, they connect event planners with local providers. This is similar to what you're planning, but for corporate clients.

**Your opportunity:** The leisure tourist market has no equivalent central directory for:
- Xiringuitos
- Beach activities
- Nightlife
- Budget restaurants
- Party venues

### 2. Pricing Model Observation

They don't show prices publicly - everything is "contact for quote." This is typical for B2B. Your B2C model with transparent pricing (200-300€ listings) is actually an advantage for your target market.

### 3. Cross-Selling Potential

Many providers listed on MaresmeEvents ALSO serve leisure tourists:
- Water Sports Centre Calella (already on your site)
- SUP & Sail (already on your site)
- Nautical clubs
- Wineries (could be day trip options)

**You could approach these businesses** - they're already paying to be on MaresmeEvents, they understand the value of directory listings.

### 4. Content Ideas to Steal (Legally)

Their activity categories could inspire your site:
- Wine tourism (day trip from beach)
- Wellness (spa day, yoga on beach)
- Adventure (quad, segway already covered)
- Nautical activities (already covered)
- Cultural experiences (could add)

### 5. The Gap They Don't Fill

MaresmeEvents is 100% B2B focused. They don't serve:
- Individual tourists
- Budget travelers
- Party/nightlife seekers
- Families looking for casual activities
- Walk-in customers

**This is your market.**

---

## Potential Partners to Approach

These businesses serve BOTH corporate and leisure markets:

| Business | Why Approach |
|----------|--------------|
| Water Sports Centre Calella | Already do leisure, might pay for featured listing |
| Wineries in Alella | Could be "day trip" partners |
| David Rent (quads) | Already on MaresmeEvents, serve tourists |
| Nautical clubs | Have leisure programs too |
| Beach restaurants/venues | Nui Beach etc. do weddings AND casual dining |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Different audience, complementary sites** - You're not competing with MaresmeEvents
2. **Validated business model** - If businesses pay to be on MaresmeEvents, they'll pay for tourist exposure
3. **Provider database** - Use their listings to identify businesses to approach
4. **Activity ideas** - Wine tourism, wellness could be added to your site as "day trip" options
5. **Quality benchmark** - Their site shows what professional tourism marketing looks like in the region
