### Costs to Consider
- Domain & hosting: ~100€/year
- Your time (significant!)
- Marketing materials
- Transport to visit businesses

## Sales Strategy

### Who to Target First
1. **Xiringuitos** - They NEED summer traffic, seasonal desperation
2. **Party bars** - Event promotion is valuable to them
3. **Late-night restaurants** - Tourist-focused already
4. **Excursion companies** - Beach activities, boat trips

### Sales Pitch Points
- "Tourists ask ME where to go - now they'll find YOU"
- "The official site ignores nightlife - we focus on it"
- "Clear airport/transport info brings tourists TO your area"
- "One payment, whole season visibility"

### When to Sell
- **March-April**: Best time, before season panic
- **May**: Urgent buyers, slightly higher prices OK
- **September**: "Lock in early bird for next year"

## Content Strategy (Free Value to Attract Traffic)

### Must-Have Content (Your Differentiation)
1. "How to get from Barcelona Airport to [Town]" - SEO gold
2. "Best xiringuitos in Maresme" - shareable
3. "Beach parties this weekend" - repeat visitors
4. "Where to watch [sports event] in Maresme"

### SEO Keywords to Target
- "Calella nightlife"
- "Pineda de Mar beach bars"
- "Barcelona airport to Calella"
- "Maresme beach parties"
- "Xiringuitos Maresme"

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Low traffic year 1 | Focus on local value, not just website traffic |
| Businesses don't see value | Offer "pay after summer" deals to first 5 |
| Too much work | Start with one town, expand slowly |
| Tech problems | Keep it simple, static site first |

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

### Launch with just:
1. Homepage with clear value proposition
2. Airport/transport guide (your unique hook)
3. 5-10 free listings to show the format
4. Contact form for businesses
5. One town fully covered as example

### Add Later:
- Event calendar
- More towns
